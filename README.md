ATTENTION: This is still somewhat experimental. I am unsure if the platform is optimal, but hey it seems to work!

Arduino compatible software for Arduino based systems, like the Mini Pro and Nano 3.0's to enable native RGB on TDA9321H based
monitors, right now primarily targeted Barco ADVMs and for now only tested on ADVM14.

Use at your own risk, and expect issues :P
